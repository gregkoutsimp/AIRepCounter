# AIRepCounter

The purpose of this application is to create a Machine Learning application for pose estimation. In our implementation, we created an application, which detects the points of interest in a human, regarding a weightlifting exercise and counts the number of completed reps. In order to successfully count the repetitions, we apply a metric in which we calculate the angle between three points and the direction of the movement. According to that we can specify when a repetition is completed.
